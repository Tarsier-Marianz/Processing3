# Processing3 sketches collection

Collections of samples using [Processing3](https://processing.org/) sketches, from internet samples (*you can find a citation of links inside source*) and my own created sketches.

* `matrix_effects` - well, not perfectly like matrix but nah, (*pwede na!* :D), keep on trying and doing my very best (*maybe if I have another spare time*).

* `fingerprint_effects` - I don't know if it's good and fit to be called [fingerprints effects](https://github.com/Tarsier-Marianz/Processing3/tree/master/sketches/fingerprint_effects), but nah... *Hayaan mo na!* . I found this piece of code from [openprocessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) site. It change the color depending on mouse position.
