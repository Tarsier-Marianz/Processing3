# Processing3 sketches collection

Collections of sketches using [Processing3](https://processing.org/), from internet samples (*you can find a citation of links inside source*) and my own created sketches.

* `matrix_effects` - well, not perfectly like matrix but nah, (*pwede na!* :D), keep on trying and doing my very best (*maybe if I have another spare time*).

* `fingerprint_effects` - I don't know if it's good and fit to be called [fingerprints effects](https://github.com/Tarsier-Marianz/Processing3/tree/master/sketches/fingerprint_effects), but nah... *Hayaan mo na!* . I found this piece of code from [openprocessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) site. It change the color depending on mouse position.

* `histogram_video` - creating [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) from loaded video file, converting every frames of video to image while looping then generate histogram.

* `histogram_image` - creating [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) from loaded image file then generate histogram.

* `colored_spinner` - spin multi arc with random sizes, every changes of the frames it also ramdomly changed its color and size.

* `orbiting_circles` - small circles orbiting big circle, *stroke of big circle becomes the orbiting path of small circles*.

* `circular_frame` - small circle changing its size every frames with a count of 5.

* `histogram_camera` - generating histogram from captured view of detected video camera of the machine.
